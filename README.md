# 🚀 Welcome to Tomos! 🚀

This repository is the central hub for the Tomos application's build workflows. Here, we orchestrate the magic that transforms our source code from GitLab into a fully-fledged, deployable application.

## 🛠️ What's Inside?

This repository contains the necessary GitHub Actions workflows to:

-   🏗️ **Build the Tomos app:** Automatically build the application from the latest source code.
-   📦 **Package the app:** Create distributable packages for various platforms.
-   ✅ **Run tests:** Ensure the quality and stability of our builds.

##  workflows

The core of this repository lies in the `.github/workflows` directory. These YAML files define the automated processes that are triggered on different events, such as pushes and pull requests.

## 🎉 Get Involved!

While this repository is primarily for automated workflows, we welcome contributions to improve our build processes. If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

**Happy building!** ✨
