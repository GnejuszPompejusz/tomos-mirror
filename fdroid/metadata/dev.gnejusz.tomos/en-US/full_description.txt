Tomos is an unofficial client for the Polish Librus Synergia platform, created to bring clarity to grades, messages, attendance and school information. Inspired by the student-focused project librusek, Tomos extends its functionality to parents as well, offering a clear and accessible view into the daily school environment. It is built on top of the Synergic library and developed using Flutter.

Tomos is not affiliated with the Librus company. It is a work in progress and may contain bugs, but continues to evolve with each release.
